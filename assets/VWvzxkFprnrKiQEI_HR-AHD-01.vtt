00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.840
<v ->Think back to a time when you felt truly respected</v>

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.750
at work.

3
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.560
Why did you feel that way?

4
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.850
Was it that you felt heard, valued,

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.100
and honored as an individual?

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.730
Were you encouraged to be yourself?

7
00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.010
Respect is something that we all want and deserve

8
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.840
and it's an essential component

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.060
of a healthy, productive work environment.

10
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.710
To create that space, let's explore what respect means,

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.753
why it's necessary, and how to cultivate it.

12
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.890
Respect means treating others with dignity and fairness;

13
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.350
however, what that looks like can depend

14
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.010
on who's asking and being asked.

15
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.530
That's because no two people are the same.

16
00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.940
Showing respect requires looking outside yourself,

17
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.550
recognizing the needs and values of others,

18
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.633
and treating people how they want to be treated.

19
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.180
A person's perceptions, background,

20
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.810
and feelings will influence how they define respect,

21
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.420
and so the more diverse your workplace,

22
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.330
the more likely you are to see varied interpretations

23
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.100
of what is and isn't respectful.

24
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.590
Regardless of who's interpreting, however,

25
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.440
a respectful workplace celebrates that diversity

26
00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.133
and operates with high ethical standards.

27
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.800
Let's examine why that matters by looking more closely

28
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.410
at some of the benefits of a respectful workplace.

29
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.850
First, a respectful work environment

30
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.190
inspires healthy communication.

31
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.610
Employees can share their ideas freely

32
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.630
and stay open to the views of others.

33
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.870
Second, since it breeds acceptance

34
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.720
and understanding, a respectful workplace leads

35
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.800
to stronger relationships.

36
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.570
Employees who feel respected

37
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.310
also experience reduced stress.

38
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.220
They can feel free to be themselves

39
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.540
without fear of judgment or ridicule.

40
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.260
A respectful workplace can result

41
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.730
in heightened engagement and productivity as well.

42
00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.650
Employees are more likely to feel a sense of belonging.

43
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.480
Finally, respect increases job satisfaction.

44
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.440
An atmosphere of respect can inspire confidence,

45
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.313
lift spirits, and encourage everyone to do their best work.

46
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.870
Creating an inclusive and respectful workplace doesn't

47
00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.460
just have positive benefits

48
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.480
such as higher performance and better team morale.

49
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.570
It can also reduce the likelihood of negative outcomes

50
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.257
like legal and public relations problems.

51
00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:29.130
So how do we build this space?

52
00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.063
Let's take a look.

53
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.220
Building a respectful workplace takes calculated effort,

54
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.160
strong communication, and consistent determination.

55
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.110
It starts with reading and following your company policies.

56
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.700
These should promote equal employment, anti harassment,

57
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.960
anti-discrimination, anti-retaliation,

58
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.720
and a code of ethics and conduct.

59
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.290
Everyone should understand what behavior is unacceptable,

60
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.780
how to report incidents,

61
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.160
and what happens when people violate the rules.

62
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.330
Second, all employees must model the appropriate behavior.

63
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.180
All employees need to stay open

64
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.820
to diverse perspectives, avoid exclusionary behaviors,

65
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.713
and treat others with dignity and fairness.

66
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.830
Senior managers and team leads have a special responsibility

67
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.010
to set a positive example.

68
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.540
Leaders must be on the front line of any effort

69
00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.503
to build a respectful workplace.

70
00:03:26.796 --> 00:03:28.050
A disrespectful leader can't expect their team

71
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.013
to act any differently.

72
00:03:30.013 --> 00:03:34.330
Next, all employees should attend regular training

73
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.580
that focuses on preventing harassment

74
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.840
and discrimination and promoting respect in the workplace.

75
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.180
Finally, employees at all levels need to be open

76
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.750
to giving and receiving feedback.

77
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.190
You can give feedback by addressing disrespectful behavior

78
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.630
whether it's happening to you or others,

79
00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.350
and you can receive feedback by listening to others

80
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.550
and respecting their boundaries.

81
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.564
If you're a manager,

82
00:03:59.564 --> 00:04:01.720
that also means giving your team regular opportunities

83
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.830
to share their issues

84
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.223
or concerns both anonymously and in person.

85
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.900
Building a respectful workplace doesn't happen overnight.

86
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.090
It requires continuous monitoring,

87
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.710
reevaluation, and training.

88
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.630
Start by familiarizing yourself

89
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.670
with your company policies and the relevant law.

90
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.100
Then, commit to upholding those policies,

91
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.040
setting a positive example and attending regular training.

92
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.070
Finally, stay open to giving and receiving feedback.

93
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.300
When you take the time to follow those steps,

94
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.410
you'll lay the groundwork

95
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.453
for creating a respectful workplace for everyone.
